The main idea behind Agglomerative clustering is that each node first starts in its own cluster,
and then pairs of clusters recursively merge together in a way that minimally increases a given 
linkage distance.
The main advantage of Agglomerative clustering (and hierarchical clustering in general) 
is that you donâ€™t need to specify the number of clusters.

The algorithm takes small batches(randomly chosen) of the dataset for each iteration.

It then updates the locations of cluster centroids based on the new points from the batch. The update is a gradient descent update, which is significantly faster than a normal Batch K-Means update.
